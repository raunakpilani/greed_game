Very Spare README to be expanded later:

3 Class files in src/
game_class.rb - responsible for initializing the game, changing player turns, keeping track of scores and ensuring game ends correctly... without fights!
player_class.rb - responsible for playing a turn and scoring it when asked to do so
dice_set_class.rb - responsible for rolling the dice and ensuring rolls don't immediately repeat

1 gameplayer file
greed_game_play.rb - nothing logicky here; simply calls the game class and calls new turns until the game is over

4 Spec files in test/
